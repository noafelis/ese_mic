### ToDos:
- convert ADC values to useful data (eg dB)
- have UDP send values recursively, should message be bigger than buffer (dito for Mailbox buffer)

### Nice to Have:
- make it so 1st button press starts, 2nd press stops measurement; data is sent continuously while measuring

### Would've been nice to have:
- nice GUI on rpi server, display values as graph
